      <h1>SPYO WALK</h1>

      title="THE ANONYMOUS ARTIST"
      text="SPYO has been active for many years, but remains anonymous. A few years ago, SPYO made graffiti art on the facade of the danish State Museum of Art. The museum had the graffiti painted over, but only a few years later, they themselves had SPYO's art presented inside their galleries."

      title="EYES AND MIND OPEN"
      text="I am a loser in the eyes of society - but I don't see being a loser as a bad thing - SPYO (til VICE MEDIA) Keep a lookout for SPYO's thought provocing art, which he calls Public Service. Take a walk through the streets of Copenhagen, and notice his art everywhere on rooftops and walls. His public service work can be found all over town; look for his characteristic aquare letters, activistic messages, and his iconic birds. "
